In this small assignment-cum-project I have performed basic analysis on the IMDb database. The work in this assignment was inspired by Database Systtem course in CMU taught by Dr. Andy Pavlo.
The URL for the database is : https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/files/imdb-cmudb2019.db.gz
after downloading and unzipping it. You can open the database in any SQLite3 browser and run the file "IMDbAnalysis.sql" from this repository.

In this project I have performed EDA on the data to answer common questions like
1. How many motion pictures' data is available on IMDB?
2. In which motion pictures did the person XXXXXX worked?
3. How many motion pictures were premiered in each decade?
an so on

For this analysis I used
1. Aggregate Functions like GORUP BY
2. String Functions like '||'
3. Output Control Functions like WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
4. Nested queries like advanced select 
5. Multiple table joins
6. CTEs
7. Recursive CTEs
